# PingyPong with enabled anti-ghosting

I have created this random buggy game just to try how hard it is to do a dynamic game... It is hard, especially if you try to use javascript and HTML elements for it.

The game consists of 4 players, one spinning ball. If you really try, you can sense gif image and pleasant chill piano song on background. And dont bother of the ball looking like a spinning head.  

DO NOT PLAY
